==============================

Python is a scripting language, and not a
compiled language. C++ would be a compiled
language.

Scripting languages need an interpreter to
translate code to instructions that a 
processor understands.

Compiled languages compile our code into a
special file that a processor can read and
understand.

History: Why is Python called Python?
Guido van Rossum is a big Monty Python fan.

When naming files or anything else in Python
never ever use blank spaces (Stefan says).

When in need of help, google Python + ??? and
click the link from w3schools.com.
