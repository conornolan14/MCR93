# This was last weeks exercise :-)
print('Hello World')  # <= this prints one string

# This is a print function to display Hello World as 3 strings
print('Hello' + ' ' + 'World') # <= this prints a concatenated string

print('Hello' * 3) # <= this prints three times the same string

# This will print multiple arguments that are passed into print()
print('Hello', 'World')

print('My favourite number is', 7)

# Solution:
print('Temperature in Dublin:', 12, 'deg celsius')
